# BattlePets

This is the offical repository for the Battlepets mod.

Battlepets is a 1.14.2 port of the 1.7 mod UsefulPets by SpaceChase0.

I am currently waiting for SpaceChase0's permission to post the mod to CurseForge, and if he does give permission
it needs to be approved on there (which will take some time).
